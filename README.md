## Keep track of where you have been last night!

The idea for this app didn't come to me because I was drunk. But I have to admit, the following has happened to me more than once. Friends take you somewhere, in a strange city maybe, and the next morning you have no idea where you've been. Wouldn't it be great if you could track all the places you've been?
